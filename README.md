I hate syncing your info on every single website on earth, so here's short, static information about me:

I write full-stack web apps with Typescript, React with Next or Vite depending on the requirements, and Nest or Express for the backend. 
I also stay up-to date with eferything happening in the tech world, if I find something interesting (service/library/article) I share it on my telegram chanel.
I speak 3 languages: Native Russian, Fluent (C1) English and French.

I go to the gym and cooking different countries cuisines.
I also hope you have a good day
